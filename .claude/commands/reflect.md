Do not make any changes to any files. The regression check above is complete — now provide an honest post-cycle assessment.

$ARGUMENTS

For each action completed this cycle, classify it:
- Real bug fix: corrects behavior that was actively wrong in a currently-reachable code path
- Defensive fix: prevents a future failure in currently-untriggered or low-frequency code
- Architectural improvement: no behavioral impact today, but structurally important at scale
- Housekeeping: code quality, deduplication, or consistency with no behavioral change
- No-op: the "fix" was already handled elsewhere (FK cascade, schema default, unused path, idempotent operation)

Flag any fixes that introduced tradeoffs or new failure modes — cases where the new behavior is better in aggregate but worse in specific scenarios. Note what failure mode was replaced and what new one was introduced.

Honest impact summary — answer each directly:
- What actually changed for a user of this application right now?
- What changed for the next developer working in this subsystem?
- What became safer under scale or concurrent load that wasn't safe before?
- Was any effort spent on dead code, zero-caller paths, or future-proofing that won't be exercised for months?

End with:
- One sentence: the single most structurally significant change in this cycle
- One sentence: the finding that should have been deferred — lowest practical impact relative to implementation cost
- Any actions where a design decision produced a tradeoff worth documenting in CLAUDE.md

After completing the reflection, state:
"Run /sync-docs to check whether CLAUDE.md and the audit.md subsystem file reference have drifted based on the changes made this cycle. Recommended if any of the following were true this cycle: a module's behavior changed, a new file was added or deleted, a known issue was resolved, or a new pattern was introduced."
