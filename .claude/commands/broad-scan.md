Do not make any changes to any files during the audit phase.

Read CLAUDE.md (especially Common Gotchas and Key Design Decisions),
README, and the roadmap carefully before doing anything else.

This audit runs in two stages within this session. Complete Stage 1 fully before starting Stage 2.

═══════════════════════════════════════════
STAGE 1 — BROAD PASS
═══════════════════════════════════════════

Audit the codebase thoroughly. For each finding:
- State the issue, cite the file and function/line area
- Severity: Critical / High / Medium / Low
- Confidence: High / Medium / Low (flag if you only skimmed this area)
- Is this a bug that would actually fire in production this month,
  or a defensive/structural improvement? Be honest about which.

Focus on:
- Bugs and logic errors in currently-reachable code paths
- Security and compliance gaps (auth, sensitive data handling, audit logging)
- Inconsistencies between CLAUDE.md/docs and actual implementation
- Dead code, unused exports, stale TODOs only if they create confusion
- Silent degradation paths: places where failure is swallowed and the
  app continues with wrong results rather than surfacing an error

DO NOT flag code for "simplification" or "cleanup" unless the current
code is actively wrong or creates a maintenance trap. Working code
that could be written differently is not a finding.

After the broad pass, provide ratings out of 10 with reasoning:
- Overall
- Architecture & Code Quality (incl. test coverage)
- Storage/DB Integrity
- Security & HIPAA
- Call Analysis
- RAG
- Clinical Documentation
- EHR Integration
- Integrations
- UI/UX
- Operational Integrity
- Operational Readiness
- Business Viability

For each rating include:
- Your confidence level (did you deeply read this area or infer from partial context?)
- The single finding most dragging the score down
- The single highest-leverage improvement and its estimated effort (S/M/L)

End Stage 1 with:
- Top 5 findings by production impact (most likely to cause real breakage)
- Any findings that contradict or are missing from CLAUDE.md Common Gotchas
- CONFIDENCE GAP LIST: For every dimension you rated Medium or Low
  confidence, list the specific files and areas you did not read deeply.
  Format: [Dimension] — [files/areas not read] — [what you inferred
  vs. what you'd need to verify]

═══════════════════════════════════════════
STAGE 2 — DEEP DIVE ON LOW-CONFIDENCE AREAS
═══════════════════════════════════════════

Now go deeper on every area in your Confidence Gap List from Stage 1.
For each Low or Medium confidence dimension:

1. Read the specific files you listed as not deeply read
2. Look for findings you missed in Stage 1 — especially silent
   degradation, cross-module dependency issues, and security gaps
   that only appear on close reading
3. Update your findings list: add new findings, revise or remove
   any Stage 1 findings that were wrong on closer inspection
4. Revise your confidence level and score for each dimension you
   re-examined. For each revision, note what changed and why.

After completing the deep dives, produce a FINAL REPORT:

REVISED RATINGS (only dimensions that changed):
- [Dimension]: [old score] → [new score] | Confidence: [old] → [new]
  Reason: [what the deep dive revealed]

NEW FINDINGS (discovered in Stage 2):
[same format as Stage 1 findings]

RETRACTED FINDINGS (Stage 1 findings that were wrong on closer read):
[finding ID] — [why it was wrong]

FINAL TOP 5 by production impact (updated if Stage 2 changed the ranking)

One sentence: the single most important thing to fix before anything else.

After I review the audit, I will tell you which findings to implement.
Do not implement anything until then.
