/**
 * Disfluency injection for the Simulated Call Generator.
 *
 * Adapted from the single-tenant CallAnalyzer (assemblyai_tool) for
 * Observatory. Real customer-service calls are full of filler words
 * ("um", "uh", "you know") and micro-pauses. Clean TTS output sounds
 * synthetically fluent, which makes it easy for a reviewer to tell the
 * call is fake AND makes the AI analysis pipeline artificially
 * optimistic (transcripts without hesitation markers score higher).
 *
 * This module applies probabilistic text-level transformations before
 * the turn is sent to ElevenLabs. Transformations are intentionally at
 * the text layer (not SSML) because ElevenLabs' `eleven_flash_v2_5`
 * model handles natural text pauses via commas and ellipses; SSML
 * support is inconsistent across model families.
 *
 * Rates are tuned per quality tier — "excellent" calls get NO fillers
 * (so exceptional handling still sounds fluent), "acceptable" gets
 * light filler use, "poor" gets heavy filler use.
 *
 * All randomness is provided through an injectable RNG for deterministic
 * tests + reproducible regeneration of saved scripts.
